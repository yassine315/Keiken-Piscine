# Telnet 
Telnet is a network protocol and application that enables a user to remotely access and interact with a computer or networking device over a network, typically the Internet. It operates in a client-server model, where the client-side software (known as a "Telnet client") connects to the server-side software (the "Telnet server") to establish a text-based communication session.
